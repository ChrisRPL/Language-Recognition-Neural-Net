Demand for new district
In February 2020, organised by various youth, religious and several political parties, nearly 3,000 people protested for the creation of a new 14,000 sq-km Muslim majority district of Sankoo out of Kargil because it remains cut off from the Kargil and rest of India during winter snowfall.[3] It had 40,000 or more than 25% population of Kargil district in 2011.[3]

Climate
Summers are mild warm in Sankoo but the winters are extremely cold and harsh. Temperatures are most comfortable in April and September, so this is the best time to visit Sankoo. As a result of Global. warming, the climatic mood of this beautiful hamlet is significantly impacted . The most widely reported impact is the rapid reduction in glaciers, which has profound future implications for downstream water resources. some of the famous but under threat glaciers are the "Nangma Serpo glacier" "Batacho glacier" "Umba Glacier" and "Gangshanmo". These glaciers are shrinking drastically Unfortunately, the study of these glaciers has yet to be done by the government to take a look [4]

Geography
Sankoo is a developing township with a small bazaar (42 km south of Kargil) and numerous villages around. Dense plantations of poplars, willows, myricaria and wild roses fill the bowl-shaped valley, giving it the ambience of a man-made forest tucked within the mountain ramparts. Two side valleys drained by large tributary streams of the Suru river, the Kartse flowing from the east and the Nakpochu descending from the west, open up on either side of the expanse. Sankoo (42 km), the next major expanse of the Suru Valley, is a picturesque township surrounded with numerous villages and colourful rocky mountains all around.

Tourism
Sankoo is very popular among local picnickers who throng the area from Kargil town and other places. Locally it is also popular as a place of pilgrimage to the ancient shrine of a Muslim scholar-saint, Sayed Mir Hashim, who was specially invited from Kashmir for imparting religious teachings of the region's Buddhist ruler, Thi-Namgyal of the Suru principality, following his conversion to Islam during the `16th century. The shrine is situated in the village of Karpo-Kharon the outskirts of Sankoo where the Chief had his summer palace.[5]
