Action (formerly known as Showcase Action) is a defunct Canadian English language specialty channel owned by Corus Entertainment. The channel was established as a spin-off of Showcase focused on action genre films and television series. Following a rebrand in 2009, the channel would eventually shift to general-interest, male-targeting programming.

The channel was first launched on September 7, 2001; it was rebranded on April 1, 2019, at midnight ET as Adult Swim.

History
In November 2000, Showcase Television Inc., a division of Alliance Atlantis, was granted approval by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to launch a television channel called Action Television, described as "a national English-language Category 2 specialty television service devoted to action movies and series primarily driven by a fast-paced fictional plot featuring car chases, explosions, special effects, or martial arts."[1] The channel launched on September 7, 2001 as Showcase Action,with the slogan 'get some'.[2] a spin-off of another Alliance Atlantis television channel, Showcase.

On January 18, 2008,[3] a joint venture between Canwest and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners known as CW Media,[4] acquired control of Showcase Action through its purchase of Alliance Atlantis' broadcasting assets, which were placed in a trust in August 2007.[5] The channel was renamed Action on August 31, 2009.[6] On October 27, 2010, ownership changed once again as Shaw Communications gained control of Action as a result of its acquisition of Canwest and Goldman Sachs' interest in CW Media.[7][8]

In 2011, Action would begin airing two original programs, The Drunk and On Drugs Happy Funtime Hour and Kenny Hotz's Triumph of the Will, both of which were cancelled after one season.[9] By this time, Action's programming would begin to diverge and incorporate reality shows acquired from U.S. network TruTV. Another original series, But I'm Chris Jericho, starring Canadian-born professional wrestler Chris Jericho, premiered as a webseries in 2013 on Action's YouTube channel. But I'm Chris Jericho would be eventually picked up by CBC Television for their online vertical, CBC Comedy, and receive a second season.[10]


Showcase Action logo used until 2009
On May 1, 2015, an HD feed of Action was launched. During this time, the channel was made available as a free preview.[11] On April 1, 2016, Shaw Media was sold to Corus Entertainment.

On March 4, 2019, it was announced that Action would be replaced by a Canadian version of Adult Swim on April 1, 2019, marking the first time that the brand has been used for a 24-hour channel. The channel launched with a two-month free preview on linear television, and an on-demand free preview to the end of 2019. As a result of the relaunch, both Cartoon Network and Teletoon ended their respective adult programming blocks and shifted full-time into age-appropriate, family-oriented programming, while Télétoon carried on with its Télétoon la nuit block.[12] The Canadian Adult Swim block was discontinued on March 3, 2019, while Teletoon at Night did so on April 1, 2019.
